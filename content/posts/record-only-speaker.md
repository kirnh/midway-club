title: "How to Build a Wearable Microphone That Records Only the Speaker for a Full Day"
---

## Overview
Creating a **wearable microphone** that records only the speaker while ensuring a full day's battery life requires a combination of **low-power hardware**, **smart signal processing**, and **efficient AI models**. This guide breaks down the key components and steps to achieve this.

## 1. Hardware Requirements
### **Microphone Selection**
- **MEMS Microphone** (e.g., Knowles SPH0645LM4H-B) for power efficiency.
- **Directional Microphone** to focus on the speaker and reduce background noise.
- **Bone Conduction Mic** (e.g., Vesper VM2020) for extreme noise resistance.

### **Processing Unit**
- **Low-power DSP (Digital Signal Processor)** (e.g., Qualcomm QCC5141, Ambiq Apollo4)
- **MCU with Edge AI Support** (e.g., ESP32-S3, Raspberry Pi RP2040 with TinyML)

### **Battery & Power Optimization**
- **1000mAh Li-Po Battery** for extended life.
- **Efficient Power Management IC (PMIC)** (e.g., Texas Instruments BQ24074).
- **Low-Power Sleep Mode** when not in active recording.

## 2. AI-Based Speaker Recognition
### **Feature Extraction**
- Use **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** or **wav2vec embeddings** for voice signatures.

### **On-Device Speaker Identification**
- **Lightweight TinyML Model** trained on the speaker’s voice.
- **Wake-word detection** to trigger recording only when the speaker talks.

### **Noise Filtering**
- **Beamforming Algorithms** (e.g., Superdirective Beamforming) to isolate the speaker’s voice.
- **Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC)** using DSP.

## 3. Storage & Data Transmission
### **Storage Options**
- **Local Storage (microSD or Flash Memory)** for offline recording.
- **Compressed Audio (AAC or Opus format)** for minimal space usage.

### **Transmission**
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** for short bursts of audio transmission.
- **Wi-Fi or LTE Module** (optional) for cloud backup when needed.

## 4. Wearable Design Considerations
- **Form Factor:** Necklace, clip-on, or integrated into clothing.
- **Weight:** Less than 50g for comfort.
- **Heat Dissipation:** Ensure efficient power use to prevent overheating.

## 5. Software & Model Deployment
- **Embedded Firmware:** TinyML model deployment with TensorFlow Lite.
- **Mobile App:** Optional app for adjusting settings and reviewing recordings.
- **OTA Updates:** To improve AI models over time.

## 6. Expected Battery Life Estimation
| Component | Power Consumption | Estimated Usage Time |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| MEMS Microphone | ~0.5mW | Negligible impact |
| DSP Processing | ~10mW | ~100 hours |
| BLE Transmission | ~15mW (intermittent) | ~24+ hours |
| Flash Storage Write | ~20mW | ~50 hours |
| Total Estimated Power Draw | ~30mW average | **24+ hours** |

## 7. Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| High background noise | Use beamforming + bone conduction mic |
| Battery drain | Optimize DSP power usage & sleep mode |
| Processing on-device | Use TinyML with quantized models |
| Privacy concerns | Store locally, encrypt data |

## 8. Next Steps
- Prototype with ESP32-S3 + MEMS Mic + BLE.
- Train a TinyML speaker model.
- Optimize power consumption with PMIC.
- Test real-world performance with various noise environments.

With the right optimizations, this **wearable speaker-specific microphone** can last a full day while recording only the intended speaker!
