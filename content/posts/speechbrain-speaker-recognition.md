title: "Real-Time Speaker Recognition on Raspberry Pi Using SpeechBrain"
--- 

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a real-time speaker recognition system on a Raspberry Pi using SpeechBrain's ECAPA-TDNN model. We'll cover model selection, setup, optimization, and deployment for efficient identification.

## üß† Why ECAPA-TDNN Over x-vector?

| Feature                | x-vector       | ECAPA-TDNN        |
|------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Architecture           | TDNN           | SE-Res2Net + TDNN  |
| Attention Mechanisms   | ‚ùå              | ‚úÖ                  |
| Accuracy               | Moderate       | High               |
| Inference Time         | Faster         | Slightly Slower    |
| Recommended for RPi    | ‚ùå              | ‚úÖ (optimized small variant) |

**Conclusion**: ECAPA-TDNN is more robust and suitable even for embedded systems like Raspberry Pi when optimized properly.

- Internet Connectivity

### Update System

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## üîß Install Dependencies

### Python & Pip

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
```

### PyTorch for ARM

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Additional Libraries

---

## üé§ Install SpeechBrain

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git
cd speechbrain
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
```

---

## üì• Download ECAPA-TDNN Model

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb/resolve/main/embedding_model.ckpt
```

---

## üß™ Speaker Inference Script

### `speaker_recognition.py`

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier

# Load model
classifier = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb")

def get_embedding(audio_path):
    signal, fs = torchaudio.load(audio_path)
    embeddings = classifier.encode_batch(signal)
    return embeddings.squeeze().detach().cpu().numpy()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    emb = get_embedding("test.wav")
    print(emb)
```

---

### Compare With Enrolled Embeddings

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

def identify_speaker(test_emb, enrolled_embs, threshold=0.5):
    min_dist = float('inf')
    identified = "Unknown"
    for spk, emb in enrolled_embs.items():
        dist = cosine(test_emb, emb)
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
            identified = spk
    return identified if min_dist < threshold else "Unknown"
```

---

## üì¶ Enroll Speaker Embeddings

Before real-time recognition, collect samples from known users and compute their embeddings:

```python
enrolled = {
    "Alice": get_embedding("samples/alice.wav"),
    "Bob": get_embedding("samples/bob.wav"),
    "Charlie": get_embedding("samples/charlie.wav")
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimize for Real-Time

### Audio Tips

- Use 16kHz mono WAV input
- Clip audio to 1‚Äì2 seconds

### Performance Profiling

```bash
sudo apt install -y htop
htop
```

### Code Optimization

- Cache model in memory
- Use numpy arrays efficiently
- Avoid unnecessary reloads

### Optional: Hardware Acceleration

- Consider converting model to ONNX and using `onnxruntime`
- Use NEON/SIMD (enabled by default on RPi4)
- Avoid float64 operations, stick to float32

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

You now have a lightweight, high-performing speaker recognition system on your Raspberry Pi. With ECAPA-TDNN and optimizations, you can enable smart, voice-driven experiences anywhere. This setup is perfect for offline, real-time applications like smart homes, security, or personalized assistants.

Feel free to extend this with:
- Live microphone streaming with `sounddevice`
- Web UI using Flask
- Visual dashboards with `matplotlib` or `dash`
